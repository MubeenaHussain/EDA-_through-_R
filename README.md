#  ðŸŒŒStellar Insights: Exploring Exoplanets Through EDA

## ðŸ§¾About the Project

Introduction
"Exploring Exoplanets: A Fusion of Astronomy and Data Analysis." This project encapsulates my passion for both the mysteries of the universe and the insights that data can reveal. By blending the realms of astronomy and data analysis, I've embarked on a journey to uncover the stories hidden within exoplanet discovery data.In this project I mainly using R programming for EDA.

##### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach in data analysis that involves visually and statistically summarizing, interpreting, and understanding the main characteristics and patterns present in a dataset. It's a critical initial step in data analysis, helping analysts and data scientists gain insights, identify trends, detect anomalies, and formulate hypotheses before diving into more complex modeling or inference.

##### Exoplanets
What are Exoplanets? Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are planets that orbit stars outside our own solar system. Their discovery has revolutionized our understanding of the universe and the potential for life beyond Earth.

Significance of Exoplanets: The study of exoplanets has not only expanded our cosmic horizons but has also opened new avenues for exploring the possibility of habitable worlds beyond our solar system.

#ðŸ“š Project Overview
Objectives:

-Analyze exoplanet discovery methods over time
-Visualize the evolution of exoplanet discoveries
-Extract meaningful insights from the dataset
-Showcase the interplay between data analysis and astronomy

Dataset
Source: NASA Exoplanet Data Website
Description: The dataset captures exoplanet discovery methods and their timeline from 1989 to 2023.

## Data Acquisition and Preparation
The exoplanets dataset was sourced from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, followed by a comprehensive data cleaning process in Excel. The cleaned dataset was then imported into the R programming environment to initiate the subsequent exploration.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Unique Discovery Types
Beginning with the extraction of distinctive discovery types and years, this project highlights the diverse array of methods employed to identify exoplanets and the temporal distribution of their revelations.
