# ðŸŒŒStellar Insights: Exploring Exoplanets Through Exploratory Data Analysis

# About the Project

Introduction
"Exploring Exoplanets: A Fusion of Astronomy and Data Analysis." This project encapsulates my passion for both the mysteries of the universe and the insights that data can reveal. By blending the realms of astronomy and data analysis, I've embarked on a journey to uncover the stories hidden within exoplanet discovery data.In this project I mainly using R programming for EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach in data analysis that involves visually and statistically summarizing, interpreting, and understanding the main characteristics and patterns present in a dataset. It's a critical initial step in data analysis, helping analysts and data scientists gain insights, identify trends, detect anomalies, and formulate hypotheses before diving into more complex modeling or inference.

Exoplanets: A Glimpse Beyond Our Solar System
What are Exoplanets? Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are planets that orbit stars outside our own solar system. Their discovery has revolutionized our understanding of the universe and the potential for life beyond Earth.

Significance of Exoplanets: The study of exoplanets has not only expanded our cosmic horizons but has also opened new avenues for exploring the possibility of habitable worlds beyond our solar system.
